## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching the theme in a limited time.<br/>
Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.<br/>
Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!
