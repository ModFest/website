## What is BlanketCon?

**BlanketCon is a collaborative event celebrating the art of Minecraft
modding!**

At BlanketCon, members of the modding community came together to create a themed
world full of booths that showcase their current modding projects, and signed up
to host talks and panels to share their expertise.

We are **open!** Visitors can explore the world with friends, try out mods,
attend interesting events, or just hang out!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to Volcano Island National Park!**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/bc25/map.png" width="50%"/>

_Located in the subtropics, I mean, the tropics? Blast it, let me start again.
Volcano Island appears to drift across the ocean all on its own. Inhabited by
the descendants of unlucky castaways and frequented for its surf season, the
island is classified for conservation in most of the jurisdictions it's wandered
into._

_Navigating these complex bylaws, the locals - the lake-loving flamingos, the
fruit-like ananas, and the geckos endemic to the island's volcano - have built
stores, workshops, communal residences, and even a seaside town._

_My pals from Rustport make trades there, in supplies. Supposedly there's this
"grand opening" coming soon. Something really special, that only happens every
quarter-century. So hey, why don't you and me hitch a ride?_

_Maybe we can finally solve the mystery of this place. You know - why it moves?
See, the geckos have lived there longest, and apparently they tell a tale of a
great turtle; one that's contently carrying an entire island on its back._
