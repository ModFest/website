## What is BlanketCon?

**BlanketCon is a collaborative event celebrating the art of Minecraft modding!**

At BlanketCon, members of the modding community come together to create a themed world full of booths that showcase their current modding projects, and sign up to host talks and panels that share their expertise.

Once open, visitors can explore the world with friends, try out mods, attend interesting events, and hang out!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to Volcano Island National Park!**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/bc25/map.png" width="50%"/>

*Located in the subtropics, I mean, the tropics? Blast it, let me start again. Volcano Island appears to drift across the ocean all on its own. Inhabited by the descendants of unlucky castaways and frequented for its surf season, the island is classified for conservation in most of the jurisdictions it's wandered into.*

*Navigating these complex bylaws, the locals - the lake-loving flamingos, the fruit-like ananas, and the geckos endemic to the island's volcano  - have built stores, workshops, communal residences, and even a seaside town.*

*My pals from Rustport make trades there, in supplies. Supposedly there's this "grand opening" coming soon. Something really special, that only happens every quarter-century. So hey, why don't you and me hitch a ride?*

*Maybe we can finally solve the mystery of this place. You know - why it moves? See, the geckos have lived there longest, and apparently they tell a tale of a great turtle; one that's contently carrying an entire island on its back.*
