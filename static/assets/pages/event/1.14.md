## What was ModFest?

ModFest 1.14 was run by the admins of the Fabric discord server to promote the creation of new mods for Fabric on the 1.14 snapshots.

As [Prospector](/user/prospector) announced it:
> Howdy ladies and gentlemen. Who wants to participate in a ModFest? The rules are simple: make mods! Basically you'd just start making mods around tomorrowish and release at some point in the next week
> 
> At some point we can toss together a site or something and feature some mods made for it. Feel free to stream making the mod or whatever you wish. You may participate individually, or in teams of positive integer numbers. I'd like to suggest making new and unique mods and not porting or recreating old ones but it's up to you.

> Stay tunedish for the nextish Ⓜ️<br/>

## Adorn

![adorn preview](/assets/submission/screenshots/adorn.png)

**Adorn** ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/adorn), [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adorn), [GitHub](https://github.com/Juuxel/Adorn)) is the one and only submission to ModFest 1.14.

It's a decoration mod that adds vanilla styled (and textured) furniture and decorative blocks! 

It's considered one of ModFest's "mascots" - by default, it's also been retroactively awarded the **ModFest 1.14 Theme Award**.
