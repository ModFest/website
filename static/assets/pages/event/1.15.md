## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching the theme in a limited time.<br/>
Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.<br/>
Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## Why was ModFest?

Almost a year following [ModFest 1.14](/1.14), ModFest was revived on its own server for a new event showrun by [Prospector](/user/prospector) and [LemmaEOF](/user/lemmaeof).

The resulting **ModFest 1.15** fully introduced the unique event format: the modpack, building, the showcase server, and submission voting.

As the poster puts it:
