#Introduction

BlanketCon '23: cyber/NOVA is an in-game Minecraft modding convention hosted by ModFest and CHS, which is open to all mod enthusiasts and developers!

Come check out a custom modpack and convention world full of mods of all kinds - old favorites, new up-and-comers, hidden gems, and more! Now in its second year and powered by Quilt on Minecraft 1.20, we're here to show off the future of Minecraft modding and celebrate the community!

## FEATURING:
- A pack filled with mods of varying degrees of notability!
- A custom Neo-Lisbon-themed showcase world built by the team and participants!
- Panels, keynotes, and more from modders and community members!
- Booths, demos, games, and more showing off everything modded Minecraft has to offer!
- The crushing ennui of late-stage capitalism! (I don't think *that* was on the guest list...)
