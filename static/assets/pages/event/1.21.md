## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders,
artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching any of the themes in a limited
time.<br/> Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with
all the other participants.<br/> Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join
to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to Stasis! You'll get used to it.**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/1.21/map.png" width="50%"/>

_It's said that long ago, the great dragon Epoch swallowed whole our prosperous
village._

_Ever since, fragments of time have rained down from the heavens - technology,
resources, and even people - dazed and confused, grasping for a semblance of
familiarity._

_And so, to protect our society and ways of life, the town of Stasis was cleaved
into "ages" - Stone, Iron, Industrial, and Information. Each meeting only at the
Temple of Epoch - where we pray for good harvests, safe travels, and low compile
times - a reminder that despite our differences, we are one people._

From dinosaurs to castle walls, and smokestacks to server racks - the town of
Stasis could be many things - so you decide! After all, _who's to say what the
townsfolk believe is even true?_
