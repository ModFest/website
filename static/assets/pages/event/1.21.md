## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching any of the themes in a limited time.<br/>
Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.<br/>
Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to Stasis! You'll get used to it.**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/1.21/map.png" width="50%"/>

*It's said that long ago, the great dragon Epoch swallowed whole our prosperous village.*

*Ever since, fragments of time have rained down from the heavens - technology, resources, and even people - dazed and confused, grasping for a semblance of familiarity.*

*And so, to protect our society and ways of life, the town of Stasis was cleaved into "ages" - Stone, Iron, Industrial, and Information. Each meeting only at the Temple of Epoch - where we pray for good harvests, safe travels, and low compile times - a reminder that despite our differences, we are one people.*

From dinosaurs to castle walls, and smokestacks to server racks - the town of Stasis could be many things - so you decide! After all, *who's to say what the townsfolk believe is even true?*
