# Introduction

BlanketCon is a new in-game Minecraft modding convention, hosted by ModFest and QuiltMC and open to all mod enthusiasts and developers! Come check out a custom modpack and convention world full of mods of all kinds - old favorites, new up-and-comers, hidden gems, and more! Inspired by BTM and powered by Quilt Loader on Minecraft 1.18.2, we're striving to create a fun, cozy, and silly atmosphere to celebrate Minecraft modding as a whole!

**Featuring:**
- A pack full of mods of all levels of notability!
- Panels, keynotes, and more from modders all across the Minecraft modding community and beyond!
- Booths, demos, games, and more showing off the creativity of our developers!
- A pink flamingo! Wait, how did that get in here?
