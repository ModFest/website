## What is ModFest?

**ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!**

<br/>

Teams or individuals create mods matching any of the themes in a limited time.

Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.

Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

<br/>

**No prizes, no pressure; just mods!**

## Submission Restriction

At this event submission mods are expected to adhere to the **ONE TOY** theme.
- Mods should contain one cohesive _thing_ (toy) - an item, an entity, a command, a deco set... - as if it comes in one "box" from a shop.
- Mods should be sweet, simple, and fun to play with - and CAN be, but don't NEED to be toy-themed (laser pistols and jetpacks are still toys!)

## World Theme

> **Welcome to the Toybox!**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/toybox/map.png" width="50%"/>

_Where do ideas go? Not grand ambitions, but whimsical, sparkly little ideas - daydreams and tall tales, inventions and adventures._

_Many are lived, spoken, drawn, sung out as true passions - but the most frivolous and playful of all are left here, in the Toybox._

_This is where they interact, clash, harmonize, and some day inspire somebody new in a whole different way - just to start over again._

_The Toybox is quiet. A lone, bright wood-block castle sits assembled around an empty dollhouse. You've been inspired - what will you leave behind?_
