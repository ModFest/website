## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders,
artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching any of the themes in a limited
time.<br/> Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with
all the other participants.<br/> Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join
to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to the Toybox!**

_Where do ideas go? Not grand ambitions, but whimsical, sparkly little ideas - daydreams and tall tales, inventions and adventures._

_Many are lived, spoken, drawn, sung out as true passions - but the most frivolous and playful of all are left here, in the Toybox._

_This is where they interact, clash, harmonize, and some day inspire somebody new in a whole different way - just to start over again._

_The Toybox is quiet. A lone, bright wood-block castle sits assembled around an empty dollhouse. You've been inspired - what will you leave behind?_
