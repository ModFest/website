## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders,
artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching any of the themes in a limited
time.<br/> Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with
all the other participants.<br/> Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join
to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## Submission Restriction

**Mods should add ONE "Toy"!**
- Toys may be items, blocks, entities, screens, commands...
- Toys may mix these, e.g. a throwable item (item+entity), or a crafting station (block+screen)
- Toys may be a "set" e.g. bat and ball, marble and track, deco block set - things that would come in the same box, collectively serving one (fun) function.
- Toys do not need to be toy themed, just toys by in-game function. (a jetpack is a toy, a laser rifle is a toy)

## World Theme

> **Welcome to the Toybox!**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/toybox/map.png" width="50%"/>

_Where do ideas go? Not grand ambitions, but whimsical, sparkly little ideas - daydreams and tall tales, inventions and adventures._

_Many are lived, spoken, drawn, sung out as true passions - but the most frivolous and playful of all are left here, in the Toybox._

_This is where they interact, clash, harmonize, and some day inspire somebody new in a whole different way - just to start over again._

_The Toybox is quiet. A lone, bright wood-block castle sits assembled around an empty dollhouse. You've been inspired - what will you leave behind?_
