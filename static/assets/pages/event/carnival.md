## What is ModFest?

ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!

Teams or individuals create mods matching the theme in a limited time.<br/>
Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.<br/>
Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.

No prizes, no pressure; just mods!

## World Theme

> **Welcome to Lemniscate River - the future site of ModFest: Carnival!**

<img alt="map" src="/assets/event/carnival/map.png" width="50%"/>

*Located just a small ways away from a residential town, many travellers from the city choose to duck through the mountain pass and pass around Lemniscate River. The roads are known to be safe, lightly peppered with merchants, and - most importantly, and like many river-valleys like it - inhabited by ghostly animal-shaped spirits with which commoners and artisans alike trade goods in exchange for magical services - simple enchantments, animating automatons, illusions, and so forth.*

*But now, the carnival is in town! and no matter what your local region calls these ethereal creatures, you can come on down!*<br/>
*Sell your wares, sweet treats, and fascinations!*
*Commune with the local elwolves, tugbats, and all other spirits tucked in the trees!*
*Tuck yourself away to hone your master craft!*
*Entertain, amuse, and delight your friends!*

*All this and more, at ModFest: Carnival!*
