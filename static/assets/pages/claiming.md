# Claiming Booth Space

Each booth starts as a **Wool Claim** - an in-world outline that shows its location and size.<br/>
Claims help participants collaborate on booth ideas and placement. They should:
- Be built 50-100 blocks above the ground, to avoid colliding with the build itself later.
- Be placed on **one side** of a tourist path - away from crossroads, spawn, and stage.
- Contain a **vanilla sign** displaying the project name, and optionally the booth concept.
- Indicate the booth entrance using **white wool**. Black wool can be used for back exits.
- Indicate if they'll be taller than two storeys, or contain a large underground element.

To submit your claim, run `/claim [submission]` in any discord channel! You'll be asked for:
- A screenshot of the claim
- The coordinates (XZ) of the map marker 
- The coordinates (XYZ-Yaw) of the warp (spot on the main path facing your claim)

### ASIDE: Booth Layouts

To make the map digestible for tourists, we use one key concept:  **Booths are like mailboxes**.
- The base map is broken into a few large, named tour paths (or "district paths")
- Booth entrances must be either ON these paths, or on a short path connecting several booths to one point on the main path.
- This resembles mailboxes - booths have a "street name" (path), "number" (point along path), and maybe "unit number" (point along short path)

This breaks up touring into completable parts (districts), and ensures they can be completed linearly - the same way you'd do a paper round!
