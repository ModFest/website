# Claiming Booth Space

---

## Submitting Claims

To complete the claiming phase, you need to reserve space in the showcase world to build your booths:
- Download the showcase modpack instance and join the **showcase server**.
- Review the booth district paths on the map, and select a spot along one to build your booth.
- Navigate to your desired spot, around ~100 blocks above the ground (use `/up 1` for a block!)
- Build a colored wool perimeter ("claim") equalling your core booth size
- Build lines ("spikes") indicating neighbouring area you'd like to decorate ("front garden")
- Place an oak sign on the claim with the name of your submission and your booth idea.
- Use white wool to indicate the rough entrance so you don't get blocked by another build.
- Once you're happy with your claim, run `/submission claim [submission]` and fill in the details.

### EXPLANATION: Booth Layouts

To make the map digestible for tourists, we use one key concept:  **Booths are like mailboxes**.
- The base map is broken into a few large, named tour paths (or "district paths")
- Booth entrances are on these paths OR on a shorter with multiple booths connecting to the main path.
- Effectively, booths have a "street" (path), "number" (district spot), and maybe "unit" (short path spot)

This breaks up touring into completable parts (districts), and lets you tour them like a paper round!
