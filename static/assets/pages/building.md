## Booth Guidelines

**Booths** are themed builds that tourists can explore, that also showcase a modding project!<br/>
Your average booth showcases a mod, and contains:
- An entrance along a tourist path with a large sign displaying the name of the mod.
- One collectible **Visitor Shard** ([Scattered Shards](https://modrinth.com/mod/scattered-shards)) placed at the start of the booth.
- A general description of the mod for tourists, written on **Text Blocks** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)).
- An interactive or walk-through showcase of the mod's features, which may utilize **Item Providers** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)) to allow tourists to obtain and utilize items added by the mod.
- Up to 3 collectible **Bonus Shards** that require interacting with the mod's mechanics to obtain. Walk-through booths may have just one of these shards at their exit instead.
- Credits for mod/booth creators, and a **Hyperlink Block** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)) to the mod page.

Generally, booths should:
- Be roughly the size it takes to demonstrate your mod (no time-wasting!).
- Have an intended path for tourists to take through the booth so they don't get lost
- Feel like a real place in the setting of the world! a house, a shop, a spooky cave, a factory, a campsite... add lore and NPCs to your taste.
- **Not** contain wings with vanilla / non-mod content e.g. mazes, bow shooting galleries, parkour courses

Update your progress (screenshot, shards, tour time) any time via `/submission build [submission]`.

## Booth Toolkit
To construct your booth, you'll have access to the following utilities:
- [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit) & [Axiom](https://modrinth.com/mod/axiom): Terraform and make large build changes.
- [Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase): Display text, images, recipes, entities - and safely hand out items/fill dispensers!
- [Armor Stand Editor](https://modrinth.com/mod/armorstandeditor): Used to make diegetic NPCs - just add glowcase text blocks for dialogue!
- [Area Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/area-tools): Powerful tool for spatial respawn points, item restrictions, and command-running!
- [Barricade](https://modrinth.com/mod/barricade): More advanced barriers with directions, entity/mob/player filtering, and more.
- [Display Entities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Display): For little details! Thanks vanilla.

Ask about the following:
- Items with CanDestroy / CanPlaceOn
- **Repeating Command Blocks**, large chains, command blocks on clocks, etc.

## Tourist Restrictions

When building your booth note that, by default, tourists **cannot**:
- Perform survival mode actions (break and place blocks, start fires, or place entities)
- Interact with containers such as chests, dispensers, shulker boxes, or hoppers.
- Interact with common decoratives such as trapdoors, flower pots, and fence gates.
- Interact with non-input redstone components such as repeaters and comparators.

However, tourists **can**:
- Interact with wooden doors, and open trapped chests (clear these on open)
- Interact with redstone input components such as buttons, plates, and levers.
- Collect items from **Item Providers** and place items into **Item Acceptors** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase))

## Playtests

Later in the build phase, **playtests** encourage participants to tour the map and raise touring issues like:
- Booths that can't be completed, are difficult to find, or easy to get lost in
- Areas without enough food
- Paths that are confusing

This process is essential for a good tour experience on launch day, so be sure to join in!

### Next: Enjoy the showcase! (or [Event Hosting ðŸ¡†](/pages/events))

> _If you're done early, you can help with other booths, prettify paths / common areas, and suggest new ones!_
> _Use available mods to build food stands, arenas and races, minigames, or scenic areas - just ask first!_
