# Booth Planning

## [Click Here for Examplse!](/pages/examples)

## Booth Expectations
As a general expectation of the showcase, booths should:
- Show off your mod by distributing and/or explaining its content
- Be self-contained and sensibly sized for the mod being demonstrated.
- Be placed on one side of a path, away from crossroads and spawn.
- Have an easily-visible entrance sign separating its entrance from the path
- Have an intended path for tourists to take through the booth (signed forks are okay)
- Be a physical place in the setting of the fest world! Feel free to add flavour or lore to your builds, armor stands alongside text blocks as "NPCs", and so on.

Booths **should not**:
- Enable griefing builds or other tourist exploits.
- Contain wings with vanilla / non-submission content
    - e.g. mazes, bow shooting galleries, parkour courses
    - These should be built as common non-booth attractions! Ask the team.

Generally, when building your booth, try to:
- Make your booth a real place in your chosen part of the world! Whether that's a house, a shop, a workshop, a shelter, a spooky cave, a campsite, a caravan... Work with the existing setting to give it some character! - If you need suggestions, just ask.
- Keep your booth roughly the size it takes to show your mod - walking is boring!

## Booth Contents

**Booths** are themed builds that tourists can explore, that also showcase a modding project!<br/>
Your average booth showcases a mod, and contains:
- An entrance along a tourist path with a large sign displaying the name of the mod.
- One collectible **Visitor Shard** ([Scattered Shards](https://modrinth.com/mod/scattered-shards)) placed at the start of the booth.
- A general description of the mod for tourists, written on **Text Blocks** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)).
- An interactive or walk-through showcase of the mod's features, which may utilize **Item Providers** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)) to allow tourists to obtain and utilize items added by the mod.
- Up to 3 collectible **Bonus Shards** that require interacting with the mod's mechanics to obtain. Walk-through booths may have just one of these shards at their exit instead.
- Credits for mod/booth creators, and a **Hyperlink Block** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase)) to the mod page.

## Tourist Restrictions

When building your booth note that, by default, tourists **cannot**:
- Perform survival mode actions (break and place blocks, start fires, or place entities)
- Interact with containers such as chests, dispensers, shulker boxes, or hoppers.
- Interact with common decoratives such as trapdoors, flower pots, and fence gates.
- Interact with non-input redstone components such as repeaters and comparators.

However, tourists **can**:
- Interact with wooden doors, and open trapped chests (clear these on open)
- Interact with redstone input components such as buttons, plates, and levers.
- Collect items from **Item Providers** and place items into **Item Acceptors** ([Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase))

## Helpful Utilities

![Glowcase Displays](/assets/pages/images/guide/glowcase.png)
**Glowcase** *offers various displays for text, items, sprites, sounds and more.*<br>
*Everything is resource-driven, so send any custom assets you'd like to use to the team.*

![Arealib Areas](/assets/pages/images/guide/arealib.png)
**Arealib** *allows builders to define **Areas** that affect players and entities.*<br/>
*This can be utilized by mods - **Meret** uses areas to add location-specific music.*<br>
*You can also use Area Tools allow item use only inside a specific area.*

![Barricade](/assets/pages/images/guide/barricade.png)
**Barricade**'s *barriers limit movement, filtering by entity type or movement direction.*<br/>

![WE/Axiom](/assets/pages/images/guide/worldedit.png)
**WorldEdit** *and* **Axiom** *let you make large, detailed modifications to the world.*<br>
*They're particularly useful terraforming, clearing space, and moving builds.*

![Fireblanket Spawns](/assets/pages/images/guide/fireblanket.png)
*Fireblanket makes entities like armor stands, item frames, and spawn egg mobs invulnerable when placed by hand.*<br/>
*To avoid this, use a command block with /summon, or a dispenser hoppered up to an item provider.*

### Booth Toolkit
To construct your booth, you'll have access to the following utilities:
- [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit) & [Axiom](https://modrinth.com/mod/axiom), provided under a permission role and removed if used irresponsibly
- [Glowcase](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowcase), which enables displaying text, and displaying/distributing items in-world
- [Scattered Shards](https://modrinth.com/mod/scattered-shards), which provides simple collectible rewards for your booth
- [Armor Stand Editor](https://modrinth.com/mod/armorstandeditor), which can be used to pose simple "NPCs" for decoration/dialogue
- [Display Entities](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Display), which have a rich editor in axiom and can be used for decoration

Ask permission for the following:
- Items with CanDestroy / CanPlaceOn
- **Repeating Command Blocks**, large chains, command blocks on clocks, etc.

### Glowcase Expectations
When showcasing parts of your mod using glowcase blocks, please:
- Include a text block listing mod authors and hyperlink block linking the mod page
- Use text blocks to explain complex or nonfunctional mechanics
- Use item blocks to distribute items to tourists instead of dispensers / etc.
    - Disable "gives item" on item blocks used as decoration or containing dangerous items


### Scattered Shards Expectations
When creating collectible *shards* for your booth, please:
- Create one "visitor" shard, placed inside the entrance of your booth.
- Create up to 3 additional shards, awarded for interaction with your submission / booth.
- Do not create shards for vanilla challenges e.g. parkour (traversing the booth is okay)
- Do not hide shards in obscure locations - they should be discoverable by a first-timer!
- Provide a hint that clearly describes shard location / requirements

## What's Next?

To help out during the **building phase**:
- Help build and prettify common spaces e.g. paths, plazas, arenas/playgrounds, spawn.
- Provide support to other participants while building!
    - E.g. palettes, worldedit, furniture designs, command blocks, item displays
- Answer questions about vanilla / modfest base mods / booth guidelines (link this!)


### Common Areas

Your building skills don't need to be isolated to your booth!

Starting from claiming, participants are welcome to collaborate with the team and eachother to improve paths and existing common areas like spawn and the stage.

Once building starts, feel free to suggest and help build new (setting-friendly) common areas! Use mods where you can - food stands, lookout spots, arenas and races, minigames, or small decorative areas. Just run it by the team first to check for potential tourist issues!
