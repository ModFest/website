## Submission Steps

To submit a project to a ModFest event:
- Join the [ModFest Discord](https://modrinth.com/) and `/register` for the event to access participant chat channels.
- Upload your project to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) (with source/description/images!) and get it reviewed and published.
- Submit your project using `/submit modrinth` and enter your project URL.
- Check the submissions section of the event page and validate your submission is visible!

If your project can't be uploaded to modrinth (e.g. a website), submit it using `/submit other` with a URL.

## Submission Requirements
In order to appear on the modfest website and be eligible in voting, mods must be:

- **Feature-complete when submissions close** - only fix/polish updates are allowed post-deadline
- **Built from publicly-visible source code** - this allows other participants to identify/patch issues
- **Developed from scratch** (ModFest) / **New to MF/BC or meaningfully updated since** (BlanketCon)
- **Free of "troll", explicit, hateful, or AI-generated content**

The team makes exceptions for slightly late submissions & fairly reused assets - just ask!

<br/>

#### SHOWCASE REQUIREMENTS

For the purposes of the event, your mod may be modified/distributed by the ModFest team.

You may also be asked to make changes to the submitted version of your mod for "showcaseability", e.g.:
- Removing a feature that creates lag, presents an incompatibility, or trips common phobias
- Ensuring **adventure mode** prevents your mod features from allowing players to modify the world
- An improvement / compatibility addition that helps make the showcase the best it can be!

<br/>

#### NON-REQUIREMENTS

**None of the following** are expectations or requirements of submissions:
- Being done, complete, or fully working - unfinished mods are welcome at showcase
- Being perfect at the deadline - bugfix & polish updates are accepted post-deadline
- Matching the theme - all mods are accepted, not just themed ones
- Having a permissive license - as long as the source is visible, you can use ARR or similar
