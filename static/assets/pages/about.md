## Who is ModFest?

ModFest and BlanketCon are made possible by **enthusiastic members of the community**. These are:
- **Participants**, who create mods, builds, and events, help less experienced peers, and bring an audience!
- **Volunteers**, who are chosen (with permission) for their skillset from our participant-base, and:
  - Contribute original art, builds, and music, help stream our events, and develop our in-house mods.
  - Collaborate on the preparation of ModFest events (mods, world, etc.) before their announcement.
- The **ModFest Team**, who are recruited from our volunteer-base through an interview process, and:
  - Handle the inception (or "pitching") of ModFest events, including their theme, schedule, and platform.
  - Make changes to our processes, as informed by retrospectives and participant feedback.
  - Administrate our platform, website, Minecraft servers, and moderate both in-game and on discord.

## What isn't ModFest?

> _Here's some clarifications about the non-goals of ModFest and its events - and effectively ModFest's "spirit"_


#### MODFEST HAS $0

We're not simply a non-profit - we have no coffers, nor revenue.

Our servers are all provided gratis, and our [album sales](https://modfest.bandcamp.com/) are split directly among artists with no cut.

<br/>

#### NO PRIZES, NO PRESSURE

ModFest events aren't competitions - they're about bringing people together.

We don't believe people need incentives to create, they just need an excuse. ModFest is a good excuse.

<br/>

#### THE MODFEST IS FLAT

ModFest isn't a job, and it's not about glory or prestige. ModFest has no owner.

We don't run ModFest when it isn't fun, and we don't hoard responsibility - we distribute it. 

Team/Volunteers aren't ordained, they're just people who step up - and they can step down just as easy.

<br/>

#### WE'RE MODFEST, BUT MODFEST ISN'T US

We might be the original ModFest, but we'd never take the ship down with us.

Our [api / bot](https://github.com/ModFest/platform), [modpack infrastructure](https://github.com/ModFest/blanketcon-25), [util mods](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Amod+org%3AModFest+archived%3Afalse&type=repositories) and [this website](https://github.com/ModFest/website) are all open-source.

Feel free to run your own derivative events - in your own community or for the modding community at large.

<br/>

#### TRADE UNMARKED

The word "ModFest" also isn't ours. We suffix it, so if you want to avoid being confusing, prefix it. 

_Blue ModFest, Green's ModFest, Old Timey ModFest?_ - just do your best to carry the spirit!

Use it as a noun for mod-build jams if you like - _There's a new modfest called [Mod Garden](http://modgarden.net) these days_...
