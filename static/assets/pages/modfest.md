# What is ModFest?

**ModFest is a collaborative Minecraft modding virtual event** - it's designed for modders, artists, builders, and players alike!<br/>
Teams or individuals create mods matching the theme in a limited time.
Then, they're invited to build showcase booths in a world along with all the other participants.
Once the showcase server opens, anyone can join to check out the submissions and vote on their favorites.<br/>


### Is ModFest a competition?

**Not really!** - ModFest is all about celebrating the art of mod-making at keeping it alive!
We're here to encourage people to make minecraft mods, and put on a fun show.
**ModFest has "awards"** - but they're just for show. Voting on mods is fun for tourists, but awards shouldn't be the reason you participate - ModFest is not balanced for awards to be fair!

### Do I need to be good at modding/building to participate?

**No!** - ModFest has no quality floor for submissions or booths.
We'll only request alteration or omission of your entry if it **disrupts other entries**.
E.g. through extreme lag, crashes, big boxy booths blocking sightlines, etc.

### Do I need to build? Will my mod be disqualified otherwise?

**Nope!** - Every mod submitted will appear on the website and be eligible for voting.
The only exceptions are mods with inappropriate content, or mods that ask to withdraw.
For boothless submissions, the team usually builds a small stand ("mini-booth") instead.
However, this is not a guarantee! Communicate with the team as early as you can.

### I'm an artist / builder / can't draw textures - can I mod as a team?

**Absolutely!** - Each contributor to a mod - whether for code, modelling, textures, key art, sfx, music - should each register as a participant, be added to the modrinth page, and run `/event submit` once the mod is ready for submission.
After announcement, participants can introduce themselves & their skillsets, and offer to help out with announced submissions.
Just remember - your team members are your responsibility; Griefing can lead to a DQ.

### What are the ModFest phases?
**Modding -> Testing/Claiming -> Building -> Opening**
