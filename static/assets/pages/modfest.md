# What is ModFest?

---

At ModFest, participants create not just a minecraft mod, but an **interactive demo for their mod** alongside every other submission - like **booths at a science fair**!

<br/>

**ModFest isn't a competition**: We're flexible, all about collaboration, and open to modders of all skill levels.
Not into building? skip the booth. Texture artist, modeller, composer, or skilled builder? sign up and team up!
