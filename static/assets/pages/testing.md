## The Test Server

Testing is run in parallel with claiming, so it uses a unique **test** modpack and server instance.

On the test server, you're welcome to fool around and try out all submissions - just stay away from test lots!

## Submitting Test Lots

To complete the testing phase, you have to complete a **test lot** - a basic test of all your mod's features:
- Download the test modpack instance and join the **test server**.
- Find and fence off an area to test your mod inside (sign it if you like!)
- Test all your mod functionality, placing blocks, entities, item providers, etc.
  - If something doesn't work, open a bug thread, investigate it, and get it fixed!
- Once everything works, run `/submission test [submission]` and upload a screenshot of your test lot!
