# Testing

### Test Submission

Once on the test server:
- Find a spot on the map and (if applicable) place all blocks/items/entities from your mod
- Test all of your mod functionality, taking screenshots as you go
  - If something doesn't work, open a bug thread, investigate it, and get it fixed!
- Once everything works, run `/test [submission]` and upload a screenshot of your testing area

## What's Next?
- Test on the test server, post tagged bug reports and ping mod authors in them
- Diagnose root causes to help speed up the bugfixing process
- PR fixes to issues if you feel capable & comfortable
