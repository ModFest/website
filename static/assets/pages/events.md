# Event Hosting

Stage events are a great way to share you or your team's experience with modding projects!

Stage events are scheduled in 1 hour slots. You can check out [Recordings from BC23](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt1hnuf_SwBeF1l6BAUaE7C3SOW63DOVD) for examples of previous panels and keynotes.

When submitting a stage event, you should already know:
- The title
- Who else is hosting it
- A rough outline of the content

You'll be able to display slideshow images during your stage event via Glowcase, but keep the text nice and large! Screen blocks appear smaller in-game. Try to have your stage event completely prepared (with your slides in-game) well before launch, in case anything gets hectic.

You'll have a time scheduled for you when your stage event is approved.
