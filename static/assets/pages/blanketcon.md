# What is BlanketCon?

---

At BlanketCon, participants **show off minecraft modding projects** through **interactive demos**, and **share experience** through **virtual presentations** - all alongside hundreds of other modders, builders, and artists.

<br/>

**BlanketCon brings modders and players together**: Hone your projects in a real-world environment, talk to other participants (or a live audience!) about your work, and get feedback from real players and modders.
