# What is BlanketCon?
**BlanketCon is a collaborative event celebrating the art of Minecraft modding!**

It features keynotes and panels hosted by members of the community, and takes place on a modded minecraft server full of booths that showcase mods and modding projects.

Once the event is announced, mod authors and other community members can sign up to build booths for their own projects, or pitch an event they'd like to host!

**The BlanketCon guide can be broken down into the event's "phases":**
- **[Signups](/pages/modding)**: Mods, booths, and events are submitted through the ModFest Discord.
- **[Testing](/pages/testing)**: Participants collaboratively test the assembled modpack/server and fix bugs.
- **[Claiming](/pages/claiming)**: Participants reserve booth space, and plan builds with the team/eachother.
- **[Building](/pages/building)**: Participants build their booths, playtest them, and improve common areas.
- **[Opening](/pages/events)**: Stage events are held, players tour the server's booths and vote on their favourites.
