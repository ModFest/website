# How to modfest

---

This is a phase-by-phase breakdown for running a modern modfest.

It's intended to be exhaustive - a bible created by studying previous events, and focused on outputs (pings and posts!)

# Pitching

---

- [ ] [#bulletin @ModFest Team] Announce the start of pitching, spawning a thread to suggest fest theme/concepts
- [ ] [#bulletin @ModFest Team] Post a 24h poll with the contender ideas from the thread, wait to lapse
- [ ] [#socials] Discuss potential teasers, branding (icon/background), etc
- [ ] [#bulletin @ModFest Team] Spawn threads for: map layout / lore, event timeline, and target version (if not decided)
- [ ] [#bulletin @ModFest Team] Post 24h polls with contender ideas OR just repost them if only one real contender
- [ ] [#event-prep-info] Post all decided stuff for volunteers to see. Create art, prep-build, dev, and music channels.
