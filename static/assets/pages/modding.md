# Submissions

### Submission Requirements
In order to appear on the modfest website and be eligible in voting, mods must be:

- **Feature-complete when submissions close** - only fix/polish updates are allowed post-deadline
- **Built from publicly-visible source code** - this allows other participants to identify/patch issues
- **Developed from scratch** (ModFest) / **New to ModFest events OR meaningfully updated since** (BlanketCon)
- **Publicly released via Modrinth** (for ModFest unlisted is okay) and **submitted via the ModFest discord** using `/submit`
- **Free of "troll", explicit, hateful, or AI-generated content**

The team makes exceptions for slightly late submissions & fairly reused assets - just ask!

#### SHOWCASE REQUIREMENTS

In the process of being showcased on the server, your mod may be modified and redistributed by the ModFest team.</br>
Additionally, you may be asked to make changes to the submitted version of your mod for "showcaseability", for example:
- Removing (or making configurable) a feature that creates lag, presents an incompatibility, or trips common phobias
- Ensuring **adventure mode** prevents your mod features from allowing players to modify the world

#### NON-REQUIREMENTS
**None of the following** are expectations or requirements of submissions:
- Being done, complete, or fully working - unfinished mods are welcome at showcase
- Being perfect at the deadline - bugfix & polish updates are accepted post-deadline
- Matching the theme - all mods are accepted, not just themed ones
- Having a permissive license - as long as the source is visible, you can use ARR or similar
