## [ModFest Template](https://github.com/ModFest/template)

ModFest publishes a mod template for every new event! 

It's minimal, but helps out with establishing some good practices like:
- A detailed mod description
- Accurate (and fully filled) mod metadata
- Meaningful package and class names
- Automatic builds via CI
- Semi-automatic publishing with build provenance

If you're new to modding, we highly recommend it, as it'll help you meet our submission requirements.

If you're already experienced, feel free to use it as a reference! You might find something new.

## [Item Descriptions](https://github.com/cassiancc/Item-Descriptions)

Event packs ship with the ability to add explanatory tooltips to your items!
```json
"lore.minecraft.lightning_rod": "A block that prevents your builds from being struck by Lightning by attracting nearby bolts."
```

This helps explain the usage of items to all players, not just those visiting your booth later.
