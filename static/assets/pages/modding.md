## [ModFest Template](https://github.com/ModFest/template)

ModFest publishes a mod template for every new event! 

It's minimal, but helps out with establishing some good practices like:
- A detailed mod description
- Accurate (and fully filled) mod metadata
- Meaningful package and class names
- Automatic builds via CI
- Semi-automatic publishing with build provenance

If you're new to modding, we highly recommend it, as it'll help you meet our submission requirements.

If you're already experienced, feel free to use it as a reference! You might find something new.
